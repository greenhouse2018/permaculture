** Global Gardener
Global Gardener is a documentary film series about the permaculture
approach to sustainable agriculture[1]. The series premiered on
Australian television in 1991

Bill Mollison presents the series' four episodes:
- "In the Tropics", 
- "Dry Lands", 
- "Cool Climates", 
- "Urban" 

each of which addresses the application of permaculture principles in
a different environmental context. 

The series is distributed on DVD and VHS videotape by Bullfrog
Films[2]. But I found the episodes also on vimeo:
